# this is 170 but running with minibatch 256 on krunch, also doubling eps to compensate for big batch size:
# use def file 153
# not doing fading
# /nobackup/kriz/tmp/ConvNet__2013-02-05_13.04.30
# logs/layers-170-256-double-eps.log
# epoch 61: set color noise to 0 from 0.1
# epoch 73: set conv1 epsw to 0 from 0.02
# after 84 epochs: logprob:  1.840643, 0.422726, 0.196598
# this matches #170 exactly, so im killing it to run 4gpu experiments
