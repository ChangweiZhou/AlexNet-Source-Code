# this is like #159 (so uses same def file: 153) but with jdexp
# this is also like 174, which uses jdexp, but 172 decayed learning rate by factor of 500 instead of 250
# so this one should be compared to 174 (which decays learning rate less) and 170 (which decays learning rate the same, but is not jumpy)
