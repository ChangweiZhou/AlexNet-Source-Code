# this is like #101 but uses wcnorm in conv2 and also has 3 fc layers. 
# its also like #109 but uses wider fc layers with dropout in all cos 109 overfit

# epoch 19: set epsw to 0.001 from 0.01
# epoch 42: this is quite a bit worse, and in an underfitting way, so i'm starting #104, which will be like this but the fc layers will be 3072 each instead of 2048
